    I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand.
    Walking through the <sub color="danger">streets</sub> of Soho in the rain.
    He <i color="primary">was</i> looking for a place called Lee Ho Fook's.
    Gonna get a <a color="secondary">big dish of beef chow mein.</a>
    <a class="color-purple">My purple class link.</a>

    He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amuck in Kent.
    Lately he's <sup color="primary">been</sup> overheard in Mayfair.
    Better stay away from him.
    He'll rip your lungs out, Jim.
    I'd like to meet his tailor.
